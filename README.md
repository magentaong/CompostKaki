## The Problem

In 2023, Singapore generated over **750,000 tonnes of food waste** ‚Äî equivalent to 30,000 public buses. Yet, only **18%** of that waste was recycled.

Most of this organic matter ends up **incinerated or landfilled**, contributing to:
- **Methane emissions** from anaerobic decomposition
- **Toxic byproducts** from incineration
- Accelerated filling of Semakau Landfill which experts have predicted to be completely full by 2035 (in just 10 years' time from now!!!)

**Composting** is a much cleaner alternative, not only to food waste but also to contribute to a cause that most people overlook: The end-of-life of food journey. But **community composting efforts** often face:
- Lack of Manpower
- Inconsistent practices
- Improper handover system.

These issues are not just any issues, they are ones which leads to expensive failures, and projects being stalled or in stalemate.

## Our Solution

**CompostKaki** is a platform that supports and **scales community composting** by transforming each compost pile into a shared digital project:

- **Log compost activities** ‚Äî like turning, adding materials, or watering
- **Track pile health** ‚Äî with temperature & moisture fields
- **Request help** ‚Äî with food scraps, maintenance, or manpower
- **Create a shared timeline** ‚Äî so no one works in the dark

By providing visibility, coordination, and collective ownership, CompostKaki makes composting easier and more sustainable at scale.
